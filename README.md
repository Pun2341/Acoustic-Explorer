# Acoustic-Explorer

This applet allows the user to generate new electronic instruments by iteratively exploring the space of timbres (tone qualities). 

The colored dots represent instruments, with the color representing some aspects of the timbre. You can select an instrument by clicking on its circle, and listen to it by playing the keyboard. When you hear a sound you like, you can click the right arrow. The selected instrument becomes the center of the wheel, and a new palette of related instruments are generated. By iteratively choosing your favorite timbre, you can converge on a unique instrument of your own! Your progress through sound space is displayed in the colored bar a the top, and you can always backtrack with the back arrow. Eventually, you will converge on a single sound, and no new options will be generated.
